Goodloe League
==============

This project is a test project I'm using to teach myself [Node][1], [EmberJS][2], and [MongoDB][3]. What's hosted here for the time being is the source code minus any database connections, since I am setting up my models and templates first. Once all that is running fine, I'll start to strap in the database code, at which point there will be more to this ReadMe (since I will need to make heavy use of _.gitignore_ to hide my configuration files from you all).

### Project Purpose

The purpose of this application is to track the evolution of our MTG:Commander metagame. It has a public URL, but that's more for our expedience (can be used outside of my house). I will post more on how the database works and what information we track once the project is up and running (and into its database development portion).

######Note
The Node app requires express (get it through npm) and will eventually require mongoose (those pieces have been turned off for the time being).
